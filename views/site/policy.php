            <p> We are committed to using a preferred network of local licensed retailers to fulfill your order handing
                off to a third-party shipping / fulfillment
                company for processing. Every item on our marketplace is fulfilled through a climate controlled
                packaging facility. Processing time is normally
                within 1-4 business days not including weekends or holidays. Depending on an items inventory status it
                may require ordering from a
                distributor which can delay the fulfillment processing of your order.</p>
            <p>All SALES ARE FINAL. Once and order has been received/confirmed/paid there is a NO REFUND POLICY. Orders
                are distributed to local licensed
                retailers and once items have been ordered the fulfillment process begins and we cannot stop, change, or
                hold orders. Only if a licensed retailer
                fails to fulfill and ship your order within 30-days does it qualify for refund. In the unusual event
                damaged items will also qualify for full
                replacement, credit or refund. If in the unusual event you do experience a problem with your order
                please contact us for replacement within
                3-days of receipt of delivery. Please inspect and document with photographs to assist in a speedy
                replacement process. Additionally we may
                require the return of unopened / damaged bottles. We may offer a replacement, discount, refund, or an
                account credit to be used for a later
                store purchase. If for any reason an order that has been attempted delivered and then returned or
                declined by the buyer which includes orders
                that are a failed delivery attempt as result of adult signature not available or not claimed within the
                time allotted once the shipping carrier
                notifies you of the delivery a 35% restocking fee will apply along with the original shipping and return
                shipping charges.
                *PREORDERS* Due to the item being a preorder we cannot guarantee the exact time or date the product will
                arrive to be dispatched out to you.
                All preordered items come directly from the distillery to a distribution warehouse then finally to the
                local licensed retailer who fulfills your order.
                PREORDERS are NOT subject to the 30-day fail to fulfill or ship policy.</p>
            <p>Producers and Brands may update their bottle design, packaging and artwork at any time. For this reason
                you may receive a product labeling
                or packaging that is different than pictured. We recommend if this occurs to visit the producer or
                brands website for the most current up to date
                packing and labeling. For these instances products will not be eligible for return or replacement.
                Credit Card disputes and bank fraud are taken
                very seriously at Royal Batch and will be prosecuted / investigated to the fullest extent of the law
                enforcement. We have in-house retired
                investigators that work vigorously in all efforts to prosecute offenders. A full screen video capture
                recording and playback of the entire purchase
                session is stored on our servers used for fraud prosecution. This allows us to playback the entire
                session just as a person visually originally view
                the site on their device showing all page and mouse movements to law enforcement. In some instances we
                will dispatch local authorities to the
                delivery address for further investigation. “Friendly Fraud” such as chargebacks for delivered orders or
                orders that meet our terms of conditions
                and CANCELLATION/NO REFUND POLICY may be imposed legal fees by which will be automatically turned over
                to a collections service company.
                For all chargeback inquiries that result in a violation of our terms and conditions or policies a $30.00
                investigation fee will be imposed to the
                cardholder as part of the investigation response. All orders placed thru the Royal Batch Marketplace are
                bound by this policy and will be
                provided as defense to any chargeback or inquiry. </p>
