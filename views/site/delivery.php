            <p>We take underage purchasing and possession of alcohol very seriously. By using the Royalbatch.com, you
                represent and affirm that you are at
                least 21 years old and that any gift recipient to whom you ship alcohol products through the website is
                also at least 21 years old. All deliveries
                must be signed for by an adult who is at least age 21. In order to protect the integrity of our
                business, we caution you that if we discover any
                violation of applicable law, we will take active steps to report any such violation to the appropriate
                authorities.</p>
            <h2 class="text-danger">DELIVERY ADDRESS

            </h2>
            <p>We require an adult signature by the recipient of any order. Our third-party delivery partner will not
                allow a package to be left without an
                adult signature, and we highly recommend that you use an office or business address for the “Shipping
                Address” when checking out. By using
                a business or office address, it will facilitate delivery by enabling an adult to be available to sign
                for the package and to take possession.
